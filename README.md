# New Yorker Choropleths!
All ingredients (csv files and R script) necessary to replicate choropleths from piece ["Which U.S. State Performs Best in the New Yorker Caption Contest?"](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/which-u-s-state-performs-best-in-the-new-yorker-caption-contest)

## See `.Rmd` file for all you need. 
# [Here's the rendered notebook!](http://rpubs.com/apalbright/280904)

Note: Originally, I used the R script `Create_Choropleths.R` for generating the visuals, but notebooks are far superior, so I've moved to that :)
